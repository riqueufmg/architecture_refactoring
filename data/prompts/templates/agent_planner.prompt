# Task
You are an expert software architect for Java systems.
Given the JSON in Input, produce a staged refactoring plan to address the specified architecture/design smell.

# Supported smells and their specific focus
- God Component: reduce size/complexity and increase cohesion; prefer extracting responsibilities to new classes while preserving public API.
- Hub-like Modularization: reduce excessive fan-in/out coupling; split hub responsibilities or introduce intermediaries to reduce ripple effects.
- Insufficient Modularization: decompose mixed responsibilities into cohesive components; prefer extract class/module and move responsibilities.
- Unstable Dependency: align dependencies with Stable Dependencies Principle; reduce dependency on more unstable packages via abstraction, inversion, or relocation.

# Rules
- Input MUST contain "smell_type" with one of the supported values above.
- You MUST NOT invent identifiers. You may only reference packages/classes/methods/fields explicitly present in the Input.
- If method/field lists are not present in the Input, you MUST NOT propose method/field-level refactorings.
- Produce a plan in blocks. Each block must be independently applicable and intended to keep the project in a compilable state (prefer conservative steps that preserve public APIs).
- Do not include natural language outside the output JSON.
- "refactoring_type" MUST be one of: ["Extract Class","Move Method","Move Field","Introduce Facade","Introduce Interface","Dependency Inversion","Replace Dependency","Split Package","Merge Package","Encapsulate","No-op"].

# Input
